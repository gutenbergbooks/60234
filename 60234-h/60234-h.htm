<p class="caption">Eunice Lake, northwest of Mount Rainier. The lake lies in a small bedrock
basin that was scoured out by a glacier between about 15,000 and 20,000
years ago. The rounded green slopes at the far edge of the lake are
underlain by rock that has been smoothed and grooved by glacier ice.
This side of Mount Rainier rises to Liberty Cap, which hides the true
summit of the volcano.</p>

<p>Ice-clad Mount Rainier, towering over the landscape of
western Washington, ranks with Fuji-yama in Japan, Popocatepetl
in Mexico, and Vesuvius in Italy among the great
volcanoes of the world. At Mount Rainier, as at other inactive
volcanoes, the ever-present possibility of renewed
eruptions gives viewers a sense of anticipation, excitement,
and apprehension not equaled by most other mountains.
Even so, many of us cannot imagine the cataclysmic scale
of the eruptions that were responsible for building the giant
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
cone which now stands in silence. We accept the volcano as
if it had always been there, and we appreciate only the
beauty of its stark expanses of rock and ice, its flower-strewn
alpine meadows, and its bordering evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Mount Rainier owes its scenic beauty to many features.
The broad cone spreads out on top of a major mountain
range&mdash;the Cascades. The volcano rises about 7,000 feet
above its 7,000-foot foundation, and stands in solitary splendor&mdash;the
highest peak in the entire Cascade Range. Its rocky
ice-mantled slopes above timberline contrast with the dense
green forests and give Mount Rainier the appearance of
an arctic island in a temperate sea, an island so large that
you can see its full size and shape only from the air. The
mountain is highly photogenic because of the contrasts it
offers among bare rock, snowfields, blue sky, and the incomparable
flower fields that color its lower slopes. Shadows
cast by the multitude of cliffs, ridges, canyons, and pinnacles
change constantly from sunrise to sunset, endlessly
varying the texture and mood of the mountain. The face of
the mountain also varies from day to day as its broad snowfields
melt during the summer. The melting of these frozen
reservoirs makes Mount Rainier a natural resource in a
practical as well as in an esthetic sense, for it ensures steady
flows of water for hydroelectric power in the region, regardless
of season.</p>
<p>Seen from the Puget Sound country to the west, Mount
Rainier has an unreal quality&mdash;its white summit, nearly 3
miles high, seems to float among the clouds. We share with
the populace of the entire lowland a thrill as we watch skyward
the evening&rsquo;s setting sun redden the volcano&rsquo;s western
snowfields. When you approach the mountain in its lovely
setting, you may find something that appeals especially to
you&mdash;the scenery, the wildlife, the glaciers, or the wildflowers.
Or you may feel challenged to climb to the summit.
Mount Rainier and its neighboring mountains have a special
allure for a geologist because he visualizes the events&mdash;some
ordinary, some truly spectacular&mdash;that made the present
landscape. Such is the fascination of geology. A geologist
becomes trained to see &ldquo;in his mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; geologic events
of thousands or even millions of years ago. And, most remarkable,
he can &ldquo;see&rdquo; these events by studying rocks in a
cliff or roadcut, or perhaps by examining earthy material
that looks like common soil beneath pastureland many miles
away from the volcano.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Our key to understanding the geology of Mount Rainier
is that each geologic event can be reconstructed&mdash;or imagined&mdash;from
the rocks formed at the time of the event. With
this principle as our guide, we will review the geologic ancestry
of this majestic volcano and learn what is behind its
scenery.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">The Changing Landscape of 12-60 Million Years Ago</span></h2>
<p>The rocks of the Cascade Range provide a record of earth
history that started nearly 60 million years ago. Even then,
as today, waves pounded on beaches and rivers ran to the
sea, molding and distributing material that formed some of
the rocks we now see in the park.</p>
<p>You may find it difficult to imagine the different landscape
of that far distant time. There was no Mount Rainier
nor Cascade mountain range. In fact, there was very little
dry land in the area we call western Washington. Instead,
this was a broad lowland of swamps, deltas, and inlets that
bordered the Pacific Ocean. Rivers draining into this lowland
from the east spread sand and clay on the lush swamp
growth. Other plants grew on the deposits, and they were
covered, in turn, by more sand and clay. In this way, thousands
of feet of sand and clay and peat accumulated and
were compacted into sandstone, shale, and coal. We can see
some of the rocks formed at that time in cuts along the
Mowich Lake Road west of the park (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). Seams of coal
were mined at Carbonado and Wilkeson, 10 miles northwest
of the park, during the late 19th and the early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>These beds of sandstone, shale, and coal make up a sequence
of rocks called the Puget Group, which is 10,000 feet
thick. Wave-ripple marks and remains of plants show that
the rocks were formed in shallow water fairly close to sea
level. How could the rocks have piled up to this great thickness?
The coastal plain and adjacent basin must have been
slowly sinking, and the influx of sand and clay must have
just barely kept pace with the downward movements.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>A little less than 40 million years ago, the western
Washington landscape changed dramatically. Geologists R. S.
Fiske, C. A. Hopson, and A. C. Waters have discovered that
volcanoes then rose on the former coastal plain at the site
of Mount Rainier National Park and became islands as the
area sank beneath the sea. When molten rock was erupted
underwater from the submerged flanks of these volcanoes,
steam explosions shattered the lava into countless fragments.
The resulting debris, mixed with water, flowed as
mud across great areas of the submerged basin floor.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="552" />
<p class="caption">Outcrop of gray to brown sandstone and dark-gray to black coaly shale
in the Puget Group along the Mowich Lake Road. (Fig. 1)</p>
</div>
<p>You can see rocks formed from these layers of volcanic
mud and sand in cuts along the highway on the east side
of Backbone Ridge and between Cayuse Pass and Tipsoo
Lake. Look there for alternating beds of grayish-green sandstone
and breccia, a concretelike rock in which the pebbles
have sharp corners. These rocks are known as the Ohanapecosh
Formation. Like the Puget Group, the Ohanapecosh
Formation is at least 10,000 feet thick. Yet, nearly all of it
accumulated in shallow water as western Washington continued
to sink slowly during the volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>The long-continued sinking finally ended after the Ohanapecosh
volcanic activity ceased. Western Washington was
then lifted several thousand feet above sea level, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Puget and Ohanapecosh rocks were slowly compressed into
a series of broad shallow folds. Before eruptions began
again, rivers cut valleys hundreds of feet deep, and weathering
of the rocks produced thick red clayey soils similar to
those that are forming in some areas of high rainfall and
high temperature today. Look for the red rocks formed from
these old soils in roadcuts as you drive along the Stevens
Canyon road about 2 miles southeast of Box Canyon.</p>
<p>The next volcanic eruptions, which may have begun between
25 and 30 million years ago, differed from those of
Ohanapecosh time. These volcanoes, somewhere beyond the
boundaries of the park, erupted great flows of hot pumice
that, being highly mobile, rushed down the flanks of the
volcanoes and spread over many square miles of the adjacent
regions. The pumice flows were &ldquo;lubricated&rdquo; by hot volcanic
gas emitted from inside each pumice particle, which buffered
it from other particles. Some hot pumice flows were 350
feet deep. The heat still remaining in the pumice after it
stopped flowing partly melted the particles to form a hard
rock known as <b>welded tuff</b>. Repeated pumice flows buried the
hilly landscape and eventually formed a vast volcanic plain.
The rocks, which are mostly welded tuffs, are now the Stevens
Ridge Formation, which you can see along the highway
in Stevens Canyon 1-2 miles west of Box Canyon. You can
recognize the welded tuff by its light-gray to white color
and its many flattened and sharp-edged inclusions of darker
gray pumice (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>).</p>
<p>Another period of volcanism followed, of still a different
kind, when lava flowed outward from broad low volcanoes.
The flows were of two kinds: basalt, the kind now erupted
by Hawaiian volcanoes, and andesite, the type erupted by
Mount Rainier. Individual flows 50-500 feet thick were
stacked on top of one another to a total depth of fully 2,500
feet. We know these rocks as the Fifes Peak Formation.
They form many of the cliffs and peaks in the northwestern
part of the park. You can examine them in cuts along the
Mowich Lake Road between Mountain Meadows and Mowich
Lake. The time of the eruption of the Fifes Peak lavas may
have been between 20 and 30 million years ago.</p>
<p>When the Fifes Peak volcanoes finally became extinct,
this part of western Washington changed again. The rocks
once more were uplifted and compressed into broad folds
parallel to those formed at the end of Ohanapecosh time.
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
The rocks buckled and, in places, broke and shifted thousands
of feet along great fractures, or <b>faults</b>.</p>

</div>
<p>About 12 million years ago one or more masses of molten
rock, many miles across, pushed upward through the Puget
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Group and younger rocks. When this molten rock cooled
and hardened, it formed granodiorite, a close relative of
granite. Although most of the molten rock solidified underground,
some of it reached the land surface and formed
volcanoes at a few places within the area of Mount Rainier
National Park.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p05a.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="801" />
<p class="caption">Granodiorite looks like granite and has a light-gray speckled appearance.
The knife is about 3 inches long. (Fig. 3)</p>
</div>
<p>Granodiorite is probably the most attractive rock in the
park. It is mostly white, but it contains large dark mineral
grains that give it a &ldquo;salt-and-pepper&rdquo; appearance (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>).
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
The large size of the grains is a result of the molten rock
cooling slowly at a considerable depth below the land surface&mdash;the
individual minerals had a long time to grow before
the &ldquo;melt&rdquo; solidified into rock. In contrast, the rocks
formed from lavas that flowed onto the ground surface are
generally fine grained because the lavas cooled too quickly
for the mineral grains to grow appreciably.</p>
<p>Granodiorite underlies the White River valley, the Carbon
River valley, and parts of the upper Nisqually River
valley and the Tatoosh Range. You can see it in roadcuts
between Longmire and Christine Falls and at several places
along the road between White River Ranger Station and
White River campground.</p>

<p>After the granodiorite solidified, the foundation of Mount
Rainier was complete except for one other landscape change
that preceded the birth of the volcano. Not long after the
granodiorite was formed, the Cascade mountain range began
to rise&mdash;not rapidly, but little by little over many thousands
of years. As the land rose, rivers cut valleys into the growing
mountains so that by the time the new volcano began
to erupt, the Cascades had already been carved into a rugged
range of high ridges and peaks separated by deep valleys.
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Deep erosion thus laid bare the rock layers in which we
today read the geologic history of the park (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>).</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Thumbnail Biography of Mount Rainier</span></h2>
<p>The life span of a volcano can be compared to that of
an individual&mdash;after his birth and a brief youth, he matures
and grows old. The birth date of Mount Rainier is not known
for sure, but it must have been at least several hundred
thousand years ago. We cannot tell much about the volcano&rsquo;s
complex youth because most of its earliest deposits are now
buried under later ones. At an early age, well before the
cone grew to its present size, thick lava, like hot tar, flowed
repeatedly 5-15 miles down the deep canyons of the surrounding
mountains. Because these lava flows resisted later
erosion by rivers and glaciers, most of them now form
ridgetops, as at Rampart Ridge, Burroughs Mountain, Grand
Park, and Klapatche Ridge (figs. <a href="#fig5">5</a> and <a href="#fig6">6</a>). Violent explosions
occasionally threw pumice onto the slopes of the growing
volcano and the surrounding mountains. As the volcano
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
matured, the long thick flows were succeeded by thinner
and shorter ones which, piled on top of one another, built
the giant cone that now dominates the region. Even though
Mount Rainier has grown old now, it has revived briefly at
many times during the last 10,000 years or so and may
erupt again in the future.</p>
<p>The events of the last 10,000 years, because they are so
recent, in terms of geologic time, are better known than
those of any earlier time, and we can examine this part of
the volcano&rsquo;s history in some detail. We will study three
principal subjects: eruptions&mdash;because they have had widespread
effects; glaciers&mdash;because they are such conspicuous
features on the mountain; and landslides&mdash;because they
have drastically changed the volcano&rsquo;s shape.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Results of Recent Eruptions</span></h2>
<p>While hiking, you soon become aware that there is a
large amount of pumice along the trails in Mount Rainier
National Park. Pumice is a lightweight volcanic rock so full
of air spaces that it will float on water. The air spaces, or
bubbles, originated when fragments of gas-rich lava were
explosively thrown into the air above the volcano, and the
molten rock hardened before the gas could escape. If you
examine pumice deposits in a trail cut, in a streambank,
or in the roots of blown-over trees, you may also note that
there is more than one layer (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>). If you circle the volcano
on the Wonderland Trail, you may notice that the
greatest number of pumice layers are on the east side of
the park, but the thickest single layer is on the west side.
The explanation lies partly in the source of the pumice
deposits, because some pumice was erupted not by Mount
Rainier but by other volcanoes in the Cascade Range of
Washington and Oregon and brought to the park by strong
southerly or southwesterly winds. The layers of pumice
thrown out by Mount Rainier within the last 10,000 years
lie mostly on the east side of the volcano. Strong winds
evidently swept eruption clouds to the east during the outbursts
and prevented the pumice from falling west of the
volcano. This pattern of distribution, coupled with the coarsening
and thickening of the pumice toward the volcano,
reveals that the layers were erupted by Mount Rainier.</p>

<p class="caption">An old lava flow from Mount Rainier which forms Rampart Ridge west

floor and cooled and solidified. Rivers then eroded new valleys along
both sides of the flow. These new valleys, subsequently glaciated, are
today followed by the Nisqually River and Kautz Creek. Thus, the area
of a former valley floor is now a ridge. (Fig. 5)</p>

</div>
<p>D. R. Mullineaux of the U.S. Geological Survey has
studied in detail the pumice deposits of Mount Rainier National
Park. One of his first and most important discoveries
was that even though some pumice layers are spread widely
over the park, they were erupted from other volcanoes.
Strangely enough, one layer is thicker and more widespread
than any recent pumice erupted by Mount Rainier. We can
clearly see that these foreign pumice layers did not come
from Mount Rainier, for they thicken and coarsen southward,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
away from the park. The oldest was erupted by Mount
Mazama volcano at the site of Crater Lake, Oregon, about
6,600 years ago; this pumice forms a yellowish-orange layer
about 2 inches thick nearly everywhere in the park. The
pumice has a texture like that of sandy flour, and it feels
grainy when rubbed between the fingers. It is so fine grained
because of the great distance to its source, 250 miles due
south of Mount Rainier. Near Crater Lake this same pumice
consists of large chunks and is many feet thick.</p>
<p>Two other foreign pumice deposits in the park were
erupted by Mount St. Helens, a symmetrical young volcanic
cone about 50 miles southwest of Mount Rainier. The older
of the two is between 3,250 and 4,000 years old; it forms a
blanket of yellow sand-sized pumice that is as much as 20
inches thick in the western part of the park. The younger
pumice layer is most conspicuous at the ground surface in
the eastern part of the park, where it is as much as 4
inches thick and resembles a fine white sand. It is about
450 years old.</p>

<p class="caption">Mount St. Helens as it appears from Mount Rainier.</p>
</div>
<p>An inconspicuous bed of pumice records the first eruption
of Mount Rainier that occurred after Ice Age glaciers
melted back to the slopes of the volcano. It can be found on
the east side of the mountain from Grand Park south to
Ohanapecosh campground (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). In roadcuts near the
east end of Yakima Park (Sunrise) the pumice forms a
rusty-brown bed about 4 inches thick which contains fragments
as much as 2 inches across. Wood from a thin layer
of peat just above the pumice was dated by its content of
radioactive carbon as about 8,750 years old; thus, the pumice
is even older. We call this pumice layer R for convenience;
other letter symbols have been assigned to the younger
layers (<a href="#table1">table 1</a>).</p>

<p>The next two eruptions of Mount Rainier occurred between
5,800 and 6,600 years ago. Again, pumice spread over
the area east of the volcano. The older pumice, which we
call layer L, covers a band only a few miles wide that extends
to the southeast from the volcano (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). The younger
pumice, layer D, covers an area at least 10 miles wide directly
east of the volcano. The distribution of both deposits
shows that there were strong directional winds during the
eruptions. The long, narrow pattern of layer L probably was
caused by strong northwesterly winds during a short-lived
eruption. The pattern of layer D was caused by winds from
the west.</p>
<p>Some time during these eruptions, hot volcanic bombs
and rock fragments were thrown out of Mount Rainier&rsquo;s
crater and fell onto surrounding areas of snow and ice.
Wholesale melting resulted, and floods descended the east
flank of the volcano carrying millions of tons of ash, newly
erupted rock debris, and breadcrust bombs. Breadcrust
bombs seem to be solid rock, but if you would break one
open, you would find that the inside is hollow or is filled
with a spongy mass of black glass. Their outer surfaces are
cracked like the crust of a loaf of hard-crusted bread (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>),
so we call them <b>breadcrust bombs</b>. They originated as blobs
of soft, red-hot lava which were thrown out of the volcano&rsquo;s
crater. As the masses arched through the air, they quickly
chilled on the outside, and a hardened skin formed around
the still hot and plastic core. As their outsides cooled, gas
pressure in their hot interiors caused the bombs to expand
slightly and their solidified outer skin to crack. When they
struck the ground, many of the bombs became flattened on
one side, but they were still plastic and sticky enough to
remain whole.</p>
<p>Bombs can be found in two deposits that form the south
bank of the White River about half a mile downstream from
the White River campground. The deposits are <b>mudflows</b>
caused by the mixing of hot rock debris with the water
from melted snow and ice. As the mudflows moved down
the valley floor they must have resembled flowing masses
of wet concrete.</p>
<p>Mount Rainier erupted several times between about 2,500
and 2,000 years ago. During one of the first eruptions, a
mass of hot ash, rock fragments, and breadcrust bombs
avalanched down the side of the volcano and buried the
floor of the South Puyallup River valley. Although this hot
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
mass flowed like a wet mudflow, the temperature of the
rock debris was above 600&deg;F. Thus, if any water had been
present, it would have been in the form of steam. You
can see the resulting deposit in cuts along the West Side
Road on both sides of the bridge across the South Puyallup
River. Innumerable bombs have rolled from the cuts into
the ditches beside the road. A charcoal log found in the
deposit had a radiocarbon age of about 2,500 years.</p>

</div>
<p>Large amounts of pumice were thrown out of the volcano
at the same time as the bombs or soon after. The
pumice covers most of the eastern half of the park, and
fragments are scattered as far southwest as Pyramid Peak
and as far northwest as Spray Park. This pumice, called
layer C, is especially thick and coarse at Yakima Park and
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
Burroughs Mountain, where it lies at the ground surface
(<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>). Here the light-brown layer is 5-6 inches thick
and consists of irregularly shaped pumice fragments as much
as several inches across. Mingled with the pumice fragments
are fist-sized chunks of light-gray rock that probably were
simultaneously thrown out of the volcano by violent explosions.
Some of these angular rocks were hurled as far as
Shriner Peak, 11 miles east of Mount Rainier&rsquo;s summit.</p>

</div>
<p>The eruptive period was climaxed by the building of
the volcano&rsquo;s present summit cone, which is at least 1,000
feet high and 1 mile across at its base. Although dwarfed
by the tremendous bulk of Mount Rainier, it is a little larger
than the cone of the well-known Mexican volcano Par&iacute;cutin
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
that appeared in 1943 and erupted until 1952. Mount Rainier&rsquo;s
present summit cone was built within a broad depression
at the top of the main volcano that had been formed
nearly 4,000 years earlier (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>; see <a class="pgref" href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>). The cone consists
of a series of thin black lava flows, and its top is
indented by two overlapping craters. Rocks around the craters
are still warm in places, and steam vents melt caves
in the summit icecap. The first climbers who reached the
top of the mountain, in 1870, spent the night in one of
these caves, as have many benighted climbers since.</p>

<p class="caption">The snow-covered lava cone lies in a depression 1&frac14; miles wide at

years ago. Liberty Cap is to the left and Point Success is to the right.

</div>
<p>Even though the lava flows that formed the summit
cone were relatively short, their eruption greatly affected
some valleys at the base of the volcano. The hot lava melted
snow and ice at the volcano&rsquo;s summit, causing floods that
rushed down the east and south sides. When the floods
reached the valley floors, they picked up great quantities
of loose rock debris and carried it downstream, sometimes
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
forming mudflows. The resulting flood and mudflow deposits
raised the floors of the White and Nisqually River valleys
as much as 80 feet higher than they are today. These valley
floors, as well as several others, then became broad
wastes of bare sand and gravel that extended beyond the
park boundaries. Later, the rivers cut down to their present
levels, but they left remnants of the flood and mudflow
deposits as terraces or benches along the sides of the valleys.
You can camp on such a terrace in the Nisqually River
valley at the Cougar Rock campground. The White River
campground occupies a similar terrace in the White River
valley.</p>
<p>When did Mount Rainier erupt last? The most recent
pumice eruption was just a little over a century ago. However,
between 1820 and 1894, observers reported at least 14
eruptions. Some of these may have been just large dust
clouds, caused by rockfalls, that were mistaken for clouds
of newly erupted ash. Other clouds may have been from
genuine eruptions that left no recognizable deposits. D. R.
Mullineaux has found that at least one eruption of that era
did spread pumice over an area east of the volcano between
Burroughs Mountain and Indian Bar to a distance of at
least 6 miles from the crater. Pieces of the pumice, layer X,
are light brownish gray and as large as 2 inches across.
We find only scattered fragments of the pumice, and nowhere
are they in a continuous layer. Where the X pumice
is directly on top of layer C, we cannot tell them apart.
The best areas for us to study the younger pumice, therefore,
are glacial moraines formed within the last 150 years,
because no pumice other than layer X is present on the
moraines. Fortunately, R. S. Sigafoos and E. L. Hendricks
of the U.S. Geological Survey have determined the ages of
the moraines by counting the growth rings of trees on them.
Their studies show that the pumice was erupted between
about 1820 and 1854.</p>
<p>Captain John Fr&eacute;mont, an early explorer of the Oregon
Territory, recorded that Mount Rainier was erupting in
November 1843, but his journals give no details. Others
have reported eruptions in 1820, 1846, 1854, and 1858.
Pumice layer X probably was erupted during one or more
of these times, but we do not know exactly when.</p>
<p>And will Mount Rainier erupt again? We think that it
will, but we now have no sure way of predicting the time,
the kind, or the scale of future eruptions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Why Glaciers?</span></h2>
<p>We frequently hear the question: &ldquo;Why are there glaciers
on Mount Rainier?&rdquo; A glacier forms wherever snowfall
repeatedly exceeds melting over a period of years.
Above 6,500-7,000 feet on Mount Rainier, more than 50
feet of snow falls each winter, and not all of it melts before
the next winter. The survival of this snow from one year
to the next depends partly on the cooler temperatures at
the higher altitudes, and perhaps also on the somewhat
deeper snowfalls there.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="caption">Two ice streams meet to form the half-mile-wide Cowlitz Glacier. One
heads on the flank of the volcano and the other (Ingraham Glacier) at
the summit. The firnline is a short distance above the junction of the
glaciers. The high bare embankment at the extreme right is a lateral
moraine that was formed about 100 years ago when the glacier was
thicker and about 1&frac12; miles longer. (Fig. 12)</p>

<p>A line that marks the limit on a mountain above which
snow persists from one winter to the next is called the
<b>annual snowline</b>, and this line on a glacier is called the
<b>firnline</b> (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>). Above the firnline, snow that falls each
year packs down and changes into glacier ice as air is slowly
forced out of it. This part of the glacier is its accumulation
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
area, where more snow falls each year than is lost by melting.
Below the firnline is the ablation area, where melting
predominates. The firnline on Mount Rainier&rsquo;s glaciers has
been well above 6,500 feet in recent years. But some glaciers
extend to altitudes below 5,000 feet&mdash;that is, far down into
the ablation area. They do this by slowly flowing downhill.
Solid ice flows by sliding on the hard bedrock under the
glacier and by slipping along the innumerable surfaces
within the ice crystals that make up the glacier.</p>
<p>The rate of flow and the rate of ablation govern the distance
a glacier extends down into the ablation zone. If these
rates remain fairly constant, the glacier will be in balance
and its size will be about the same from year to year. But
if changing weather patterns affect the rates of ablation or
accumulation, or both, the glacier will either become smaller
or grow larger. The change you are most likely to notice is
in the position of the glacier&rsquo;s terminus, which may either
recede or advance, but precise measurements of the upper
reaches of a glacier also show volume changes there, some
of which may not affect the glacier&rsquo;s terminus for many
years, if ever.</p>
<p>Crevasses are a glacier&rsquo;s most awesome features and are
a constant hazard for climbers. They form where adjacent
parts of a glacier are moving at different speeds. Some of
Mount Rainier&rsquo;s glaciers may be flowing at a speed of several
thousand feet per year along their centers but at a
much slower rate along their margins. This unequal rate of
flow produces stresses in the ice that cause it to break.
Groups of crevasses often form where the glacier flows over
a steep place in its bed. The ice moves faster here, and pulls
apart, and a crevasse is formed. Although a large crevasse
may seem to be bottomless to the observer, most crevasses
are less than 100 feet deep because ice pressure tends to
close the open spaces in the ice below that depth.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Ice covers 37 square miles of the park today. Individual
glaciers that make up this ice blanket are placed into three
groups, depending on their place of origin. Those of one
group originate at the volcano&rsquo;s summit and flow far down
the valleys that radiate from the cone. Most of the snow
that nourishes these glaciers probably falls on them at altitudes
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
well below the summit. The largest examples of the
group are the Emmons, Nisqually, and Tahoma Glaciers.</p>
<p>Glaciers of the second group originate on the flanks of
the volcano, mostly at altitudes between 7,000 and 10,000
feet. This group is represented by the South Tahoma, Carbon,
and Inter Glaciers. Glaciers of the third group are on
north-facing slopes in the mountains around Mount Rainier.
They are mostly at altitudes of about 6,000 feet, and they
owe their existence to locations well protected from solar
heat. Glaciers representing this group are the Unicorn and
Pinnacle Glaciers in the Tatoosh Range, a small unnamed
glacier near the west end of Burroughs Mountain, and the
somewhat larger Sarvent Glaciers east of Mount Rainier.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Work Habits of Glaciers</span></h2>
<p>Glaciers are extremely capable workers. Their work includes
<b>erosion, transportation, and deposition</b>. The smoothed
and grooved bedrock at Box Canyon and at many points
along the trail to the ice caves near Paradise Park shows
erosion of rock by glacier ice. Rock fragments carried by
glaciers cut grooves in the hard bedrock and polish its surface (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>). Although any one rock fragment might scrape
away only 1 millimeter of rock along a single groove, the
total effect is great when multiplied by countless thousands
of similar fragments rasping a bedrock surface for hundreds
or thousands of years. Glacier ice may also break chunks of
rock loose as it overrides them and may even plow up sections
of softer rocks.</p>
<p>Glaciers transport not only the rocks that they quarry
and scrape from their beds but also, more conspicuously,
those that fall onto their surfaces from nearby cliffs. These
falling rocks range in size from tiny particles to individual
masses that weigh tens of thousands of tons, like those that
fell onto Emmons Glacier from Little Tahoma Peak in 1963.
(See <a class="pgref" href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>.)</p>
<p>A glacier deposits most rock debris at its terminus. The
steep snout of any major glacier is a dangerous place to
approach closely because rock debris almost constantly falls,
rolls, and slides down the melting ice faces. Much of this
debris collects at the ice margin, and if the margin stays in
one place long enough a ridge-shaped <b>end moraine</b> of rock
debris forms along the ice front (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>). If such a moraine
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
forms across the front of a glacier at its farthest advance
it is called a <b>terminal moraine</b>. End moraines that form as
the ice recedes are called <b>recessional moraines</b> (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>).
Ridges of rock debris that form along the sides of a glacier
are called <b>lateral moraines</b> (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>).</p>
<p>Some recent moraines of modern glaciers are only a few
feet away from the present ice margin; others, formed thousands
of years ago during the most recent major glaciation,
are on ridgetops and valley sides or floors miles away from
modern glaciers. By examining the shape and location of
these moraines, we can reconstruct the size and character
of past glaciers, as we will see in the <a href="#c6">next section</a>.</p>

a small horseshoe-shaped end moraine of Flett Glacier, on the northwest

(Fig. 14)</p>
</div>
<p>Glaciers erode, transport, and deposit huge quantities of
rock debris. So do their coworkers, the melt-water streams.
These turbulent streams flow from tunnels beneath every
glacier, and their degree of muddiness roughly shows how
active the glacier is. Glaciers that move very slowly, or that
are stagnant, produce relatively clear melt water because
they are not actively eroding bedrock. In contrast, streams
of muddy water that look like chocolate milk often come
from very active or &ldquo;live&rdquo; glaciers. These streams carry
rock debris ranging from flour-size particles to large boulders.
You can sense the carrying power of this swiftly
moving water on warm summer days, when large cobbles
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
and boulders are bumping along in a stream swollen by
rapid glacier melting. Although you can rarely see these
boulders, you can hear their constant low thunder. Their
repeated impacts on other boulders in the streambed will
vibrate the nearby streambanks beneath your feet. Hikers
often find that a melt-water stream safe to cross in the
early morning of a warm summer day is an impassable
torrent at the same spot by early afternoon.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">

<p class="caption">Four curved recessional moraines are spread over a distance of
2,000 feet on the valley floor of Fryingpan Creek. They were formed
within the last few hundred years as Fryingpan Glacier lost volume and

</div>
<p>A melt-water stream generally deposits coarse material
wherever the slope of the valley floor decreases and the
stream loses some of its velocity and carrying power. Only
a flood may move the boulders farther downstream. However,
the current carries fine material far downstream to
deposit it in lakes, in Puget Sound, or in the Pacific Ocean.
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
The Puyallup River, for example, is still very muddy where
it enters Puget Sound at Tacoma, more than 40 miles from
its source in the glaciers on Mount Rainier.</p>
<p>During the last glaciation, when glaciers were much
larger than they are now, melt-water streams carrying great
quantities of sand and gravel built valley floors up to levels
tens of feet higher than they are today. Later, as the glaciers
grew smaller, the rivers cut down into their valley
floors and remnants of the sand and gravel deposits were
left standing in benches or terraces along the sides of the
valleys. You can see a good example of such a terrace in
the Nisqually River valley beyond Ashford, which is 5 miles
west of the park. You cross it on the highway that leads to
the park. Cuts beneath the terrace reveal deposits of sand,
cobbles, and boulders that look the same as those deposits
being formed today by melt-water streams. The terrace west
of Ashford was formed a little more than 15,000 years ago,
when a glacier extended down the Nisqually River valley
to the vicinity of Ashford.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Yesterday&rsquo;s Glaciers</span></h2>
<p>Mount Rainier&rsquo;s great sprawling cone would seem incomplete
without the glistening sheets of ice that descend its
flanks. We have reason to believe that the volcano has borne
glaciers ever since its origin&mdash;sometimes smaller than now,
at other times vastly larger. Mount Rainier probably started
to grow during the middle part of the Pleistocene Epoch, or
Ice Age, which began more than 1 million years ago, but
glaciers had covered this part of the mountains even before
the volcano appeared. Masses of rock debris formed by ancient
glaciers occur beneath lava flows from Mount Rainier
on the west side of Mazama Ridge just upslope from Narada
Falls, on the north side of Glacier Basin, and at a few other
places in the park.</p>
<p>Mount Rainier may have reached its present size by about
75,000 years ago. Since that time great icefields and glaciers
have formed at least three times on the slopes of the volcano
and in the nearby mountains. During the first two glaciations,
ice completely buried the flanks of the volcano and
the surrounding mountains, except for the very highest
ridges and peaks. These great ice masses slowly flowed down
all the valleys that head at Mount Rainier. The glacier in
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
the Cowlitz River valley, for example, extended 65 miles
from the volcano and reached a point about 33 miles west
of the community of Randle. Deposits of the younger of
these two glacial episodes can be seen in cuts along the
Mowich Lake Road for a distance of about 1&frac12; miles inside
the park boundary. The glacial deposits were originally more
widespread, but in most of the park they have been removed
by erosion or covered by the deposits of yet younger
glaciers.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>During the most recent major glaciation of the park,
which lasted from roughly 25,000 to 10,000 years ago, ice
again sheathed the slopes of the volcano, but glaciers in
the nearby mountains were smaller than before. Most of the
glaciers originated at the valley heads, where they gouged
out countless bowl-shaped bedrock basins called <b>cirques</b>.
Many of the basins held lakes after the glaciers disappeared.
(See <a href="#pic_1">frontispiece</a>.) Hikers on the trail to the Paradise ice
caves cross the floor of a typical cirque at the head of Paradise
Valley. From the Sunrise Visitor Center at Yakima
Park you can walk a short distance to a point along the
crest of the Sourdough Mountains and stand at the rim of
a deep north-facing cirque. Ice originating in this cirque
and in the cirques adjacent to it moved northward down
the valley of Huckleberry Creek at least as far as the park&rsquo;s
north boundary (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>).</p>
<p>These glaciers left most valley walls in the park covered
with rock debris. Lateral moraines can be seen along the
highway at and just east of Ricksecker Point (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>). Other
glacial deposits are especially well displayed in roadcuts
along the north wall of the White River valley.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p15a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="629" />
<p class="caption">Lateral moraine of rock debris at Ricksecker Point. It was formed by
Nisqually Glacier when the glacier was at least 1,000 feet thick and
about 15 miles longer than it is today. (Fig. 17)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>A little more than 15,000 years ago the long glaciers
began to shrink and recede. By 11,000 years ago there was
only about as much ice on Mount Rainier as there has been
within the last century. Then, during a short period of renewed
glacier growth, most glaciers expanded short distances
and new ones appeared in cirques from which ice
had disappeared only a short time before. In some of these
cirques so much rock debris was being dislodged from surrounding
cliffs by repeated freeze and thaw that a <b>rock
glacier</b>, consisting mostly of rock fragments bound together
by ice, was formed. A trail to the Huckleberry Creek valley
crosses hummocky rock debris left by such a rock glacier
in a cirque on the southeast side of Mount Fremont. A larger
rock-glacier deposit lies about 2 miles north of Sunrise
Point in an east-facing cirque between The Palisades and
Hidden Lake (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>).</p>
<p>In other cirques, where the proportion of ice to rock
debris was greater, the glacier transported the debris a short
distance forward and built a terminal moraine. You can see
particularly good examples of moraines formed about 11,000
years ago near Tipsoo Lake, where the pond southeast of
the lake is dammed by a moraine, and at Mystic Lake. The
ice that formed the terminal moraine at Mystic Lake was a
tongue of Carbon Glacier.</p>
<p>In some places the orientation or altitude of the cirque
did not permit enough snow to accumulate to form a glacier
but just enough to create a permanent snowbank. Rock
debris that fell from the surrounding cliffs rolled down these
snowbanks and formed low ridges at their toes. Such a ridge
is called a <b>protalus rampart</b> because it is found just in front
of the apron of rock fragments, called <b>talus</b>, that lies beneath
cliffs. A trail at Sunrise Point leads to protalus ramparts
along the north side of Sunrise Ridge.</p>
<p>During the last 10,000 years, glaciers have been very
small by comparison with the great ice mantles that overwhelmed
the park earlier. However, glaciers have grown
larger at least twice just within the last 3,000 years. During
both of these periods most glaciers were slightly larger than
they are today, and ice occupied most cirques at altitudes
above 6,500 feet&mdash;even some that are now free of ice. The
most recent time of extensive glacier growth began at least
800 years ago, and various glaciers in the park reached their
maximum size between the mid-14th century and the mid-19th
century. Oddly enough, even though all the glaciers
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
headed on Mount Rainier, they did not all attain their maximum
size simultaneously. The largest terminal moraine of
this most recent glacial period was built by Emmons Glacier
in the White River valley (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>). It is now largely forested,
and cores taken from the trees with a special boring
tool that does not harm the tree show ages indicating that
the moraine was stable enough to permit seedlings to survive
on it by the mid-17th century. A similar but smaller
terminal moraine built by Cowlitz Glacier has trees on it
that started to grow in the mid-14th century.</p>

<p class="caption">Rock-glacier deposit (light-gray rubble beyond the brown slopes in

cliffs in such great quantity that a small glacier in front of the cliffs
consisted of more rock debris than ice. The melting of the ice left a
mass of broken rock several hundred feet thick which covers about
80 acres. (Fig. 18)</p>

glacier ends 1 mile farther upvalley at the upper right. The valley floor

</div>
<p>Nearly all the glaciers gradually decreased in size after
the mid-18th century. Although the shrinkage was sometimes
interrupted by short periods of renewed glacier
growth, by 1950 the glaciers at Mount Rainier covered only
about two-thirds of the area that had been buried by ice
only a century before. The overall loss of volume by Rainier&rsquo;s
glaciers, as well as those elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest,
was slowed or halted by slightly cooler temperatures and
higher precipitation starting in the mid-1940&rsquo;s. Volume increases
in their upper reaches caused the larger glaciers to
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
grow from year to year, and since the early 1950&rsquo;s the
terminuses of many glaciers have been advancing. This
renewed growth of glaciers is not unique at Mount Rainier&mdash;similar
changes have been observed at other glaciers in
the Cascade Range and elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Landslides and Mudflows&mdash;Past, Present, and Future</span></h2>
<p>Some of the most effective means of erosion at Mount
Rainier are landslides and mudflows. Erosion of this kind is
sometimes spectacular. Within an interval of only minutes
or a few hours huge masses of rock may fall, slide, or flow
off the volcano and move far downvalley.</p>
<p>Large landslides have occurred at many other places in
the park&mdash;one in the area northeast of Mount Rainier is so
conspicuous that its source has been named Slide Mountain.
The ragged scar left by another slide near Grand Park is
aptly called Scarface. You cross a slide on the Mather Memorial
Parkway (U.S. Highway 410) just north of Cayuse
Pass. Broken and jumbled rock debris of many sizes borders
both sides of the highway there. This landslide broke loose
in rocks of the Ohanapecosh Formation, slid downslope to
the bottom of the valley, and dammed Klickitat Creek to
form Ghost Lake. Rocks have also slid downslope on the
west side of Backbone Ridge and on the east side of the
Ohanapecosh River valley a short distance north of Ohanapecosh
campground. The slide on Backbone Ridge is still
slowly moving today. Another slide moves a few inches each
year on the west side of the Nisqually River valley about
1 mile northwest of the visitor center at Paradise Park.
You can recognize the slide by a jagged horizontal crack
1,000 feet long at its top.</p>
<p>A far more spectacular variety of landslide occurs when
a mass of rock drops from a cliff to form a <b>rockfall</b>. The
largest rockfalls on Mount Rainier in historic time occurred
in December 1963 on the east flank. Masses of rock hundreds
of feet across fell repeatedly from the steep north face of
Little Tahoma Peak onto Emmons Glacier. The rock masses
shattered into dust and countless fragments, fanned out
across the glacier, then avalanched down the steep ice surface
at tremendous speed. When the avalanches reached
the end of the glacier they shot out into space as sheets
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
of rock debris. As these hurtling sheets settled toward the
valley floor, a cushion of compressed air formed beneath
them, comparable to the air cushion that momentarily buoys
up a sheet of plywood that is dropped onto a flat surface.
Air that was trapped beneath these speeding avalanches
reduced friction and permitted one of the avalanches to
move almost 2 miles beyond the end of the glacier. This
avalanche passed completely over a small wooden gage house
about 5 feet high on the valley floor without damaging it,
then ran headlong into the north base of Goat Island Mountain
where it scraped away trees and bushes. A later avalanche
stopped just short of the gage house, and wind that
was expelled from beneath the rock debris blasted the still-undamaged
house several hundred feet forward. It now rests
in the scar left by the earlier avalanche on the side of Goat
Island Mountain.</p>
<p>At least seven rockfalls and avalanches descended from
Little Tahoma Peak, separated perhaps by only minutes or
hours. The reddish-gray masses of broken and pulverized
rock&mdash;some spread helter-skelter, some piled in long sharp-crested
ridges&mdash;now lie on the valley floor between the
White River campground and Emmons Glacier (<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>).</p>
<p>The rockfalls might have been caused by a steam explosion
near the base of Little Tahoma Peak. Steam jets
and small explosions are not unusual phenomena at Mount
Rainier, although they never have had such dramatic effects
in historic time.</p>
<p>Incredibly larger avalanches of rock fell repeatedly from
the sides of Mount Rainier during prehistoric time. One such
avalanche originated near the summit of the volcano and
blanketed Paradise Park and Paradise Valley with a yellowish-orange
mixture of clay and rocks sometime between
5,800 and 6,600 years ago. You can see this avalanche deposit
in shallow cuts along trails and roads in the Paradise
area. Huge blocks of rock that came down with the avalanche
are scattered in the meadows of Paradise Park between
the visitor center and Panorama Point. Although the
deposit is now less than 15 feet thick in most places, the
mass that flowed down Paradise Valley must have been
600 feet thick, because we can find remnants of it on top
of Mazama Ridge. A tongue of the wet mass flowed through
a low saddle near the south end of Mazama Ridge and extended
into the basin now occupied by the Reflection Lakes.

You can see the yellowish-orange deposit in the first roadcut
west of the lakes, where it lies on top of gray glacial
deposits.</p>

<p class="caption">Avalanche deposits in the White River valley. The rockfalls and
avalanches from Little Tahoma Peak formed a mass of reddish-gray
rock debris that contrasts with the darker gray glacial debris deposited
by Emmons Glacier within the last century. The avalanche deposits are
about 1,500 feet across at their widest point. (Fig. 20)</p>
</div>
<p>The avalanche probably was wet when it crossed the
Paradise area, and the moisture in it may have already been
present in the rocks in which the avalanche originated. The
mass was fluid enough to move down the Paradise and Nisqually
River valleys as a mudflow hundreds of feet thick,
and the resulting deposits extend at least 18 miles downstream
from the volcano. The volume of rock that slid off
to produce the mudflow may have been as much as 100
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
million cubic yards&mdash;or roughly enough to cover a 1-mile-square
area to a depth of 100 feet.</p>
<p>At about the same time as the Paradise avalanche and
mudflow occurred, a tremendous rock mass also slid off the
east side of the volcano in the area between Steamboat Prow
and Little Tahoma Peak. This slide formed a mudflow on
the floor of the White River valley that was several hundred
feet deep at the north boundary of the park and that extended
at least 30 miles beyond the base of the volcano. The
most remarkable feature of the deposit left by this mudflow
is its surface, which is dotted with scores of mounds 5-35
feet high and as much as several hundred feet in diameter.
These mounds have cores of huge rocks which are similar
in size to those scattered on the surface of the avalanche
deposits from Little Tahoma Peak. You can see the mounds
best in an area which is a few miles north of the park boundary,
west of the White River, and which can be reached by
the Huckleberry Creek Forest Road. The total volume of this
mudflow deposit may be as much as one-fifth of a cubic mile.</p>
<p>These great landslides and mudflows were followed
shortly by another whose size surpassed that of anything
before or since. This was the remarkable Osceola Mudflow,
which streamed down the valleys of the White River and
West Fork about 5,800 years ago. When these great rivers
of mud joined in the White River valley, they formed an
even larger mudflow which swiftly flowed downvalley for a
distance of 15 miles and then spread beyond the Cascade
mountain front into the Puget Sound lowland. There the
mudflow submerged a total area of more than 100 square
miles to depths as great as 70 feet and buried the sites of
the present towns of Enumclaw and Buckley. One tongue
of it even flowed into an arm of Puget Sound, south of
Seattle, that has since been filled with river deposits to
form the fertile valley occupied by the towns of Kent, Auburn,
Sumner, and Puyallup.</p>
<p>The Osceola Mudflow is remarkable in that it affected
areas so far from its place of origin. This long distance of
travel was due to its great volume, which we estimate to
have been more than half a cubic mile, and to the abundance
of slippery clay in it. The clay had been formed by the
alteration of rocks in the volcano by hot gases and solutions
over many centuries.</p>

<p class="caption">The northeast flank of Mount Rainier. A remnant of the Osceola
Mudflow lies at the summit of Steamboat Prow in the center. Two and
one-half miles to the left is Little Tahoma Peak, from whose steep north
face at least seven large masses of rock fell in 1963. Mount Adams
volcano can be seen at the left, and Mount Hood, Oregon, in the far
distance. (Fig. 21)</p>
</div>
<p>Where did the Osceola Mudflow originate on the volcano?
This we must deduce from several lines of evidence. The mudflow
occurred so long ago that there is no historical record,
and volcanic events since that time have covered up part
of the scar it left on the volcano. Remnants of the Osceola
Mudflow veneer the sides and ridges of Glacier Basin, and
a small amount of it is even preserved at the top of Steamboat
Prow, at an altitude of 9,700 feet (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>). This distribution
tells us that the slides responsible for the mudflow
originated somewhere on the volcano above Steamboat Prow.
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
But now there is no great chasm in the side of the volcano
large enough to have provided a source of the mudflow; so
we must consider a former summit of the volcano itself as
a possible source.</p>
<p>I. C. Russell, one of the first geologists to study Mount
Rainier, wrote in 1896 that the present summit of the volcano
consists of a small lava cone. Enclosing this cone is a
broad depression whose rim is partly preserved at Gibraltar
Rock, Point Success, and Liberty Cap (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>). High points
on the rim indicate that the former summit of the volcano
above an altitude of about 14,000 feet was removed in some
way. The destruction of the old summit, which may have
reached a height of 16,000 feet, left a broad east-facing
depression in the top of the volcano between Gibraltar Rock
and Russell Cliff. The depression has since been mostly filled
by the recent lava cone. You can see these features best
from high points east of the mountain.</p>
<p>Our best explanation of how the former top of the volcano
was removed also solves the problem of finding an
adequate source of material for the Osceola Mudflow. Before
5,800 years ago, the topmost part of Mount Rainier probably
consisted of rock that had been weakened by hot volcanic
fumes and solutions and partly converted to clay. Then, this
mass of weak rock was jostled off or pushed off by a volcanic
explosion and slid down the northeast side of the volcano.
One or more of these mighty avalanches of moist clay and
rock resulted in the Osceola Mudflow.</p>
<p>Large avalanches have also occurred many times during
the last 3,000 years on the west side of the volcano. Sunset
Amphitheater (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>) is part of the large scar left by
them. About 2,800 years ago one of these avalanches created
a mudflow in the valleys of the South Puyallup River and
Tahoma Creek that was temporarily deep enough to submerge
Round Pass (on the West Side Road) to a depth of
nearly 400 feet. This is especially remarkable when we see
that Round Pass itself is 600-700 feet above the nearby
valley floors. Another deep mudflow, started by an avalanche
at Sunset Amphitheater, moved down the Puyallup River
valley about 600 years ago and buried the site of the present
town of Orting in the Puget Sound lowland under 15 feet of
mud and rock.</p>

<p>Avalanches and mudflows like those described are normal
events at Mount Rainier and are expected to happen again
in the future. Almost any cliff on the volcano can produce a
large rockfall, but which cliff will collapse next, or when,
cannot be predicted. Should the volcano again become active,
earthquakes and volcanic explosions would trigger avalanches
and mudflows that would rush down the mountain.
Molten rock would melt snow and ice at the volcano&rsquo;s summit
and send floods of water down the volcano&rsquo;s flanks. These
indirect effects of an eruption would be much more hazardous
than lava flows and pumice, if eruptions are on a scale
similar to that of the past 10,000 years.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">The Volcano&rsquo;s Future?</span></h2>
<p>An active volcano changes continually. Repeated eruptions
build the cone by piling one lava flow on top of others,
or on top of other volcanic formations. Simultaneously, the
combined processes of erosion wear the volcano down. The
relative importance of the two processes&mdash;one building, the
other destroying&mdash;is reflected in the volcano&rsquo;s shape. The
scarred and deeply gouged sides of Rainier&rsquo;s cone show that
erosion has been dominant here for a long time. Is Mount
Rainier now doomed to continued piecemeal destruction until
the lofty cone is reduced to a featureless mound? Will future
eruptions of lava restore some of the volcano&rsquo;s bulk? Or will
the volcano erupt violently some day, and then collapse as
did Mount Mazama to form the deep basin of Crater Lake?
The answers may not be known for centuries&mdash;or they may
appear tomorrow.</p>
